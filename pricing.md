#### Why is it not free

Mike Perham, the creator of the popular gem [sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) helped inpire the decision. He built a business around an open-source project that allowed him to work full-time on it which benefits the users because they get new features and updates regularly. That's the dream!

#### ELv2 Version
                    
Gemfast is available to use for free with a limited feature set. To use the free version, [download and install the product following the documentation](/docs/install) and start the server without providing a license key.

The free version of Gemfast supports:

* <strong>Private Gem Hosting</strong>
* <strong>Automatic HTTPS</strong>
* <strong>Pre-Packed `.deb` Installer</strong>

#### Licensed Version

Gemfast licenses are available as an annual subscription. Buying a license enables all features of Gemfast for production use for 1 server instance. Your subscription will automatically renew every year unless it is canceled.

It is recommended that you purchase any licenses using a group email account so the license is not attached to any one employee's email address. 

Paid versions of Gemfast include a commercial friendly license instead of the ELv2 license of the free version.
